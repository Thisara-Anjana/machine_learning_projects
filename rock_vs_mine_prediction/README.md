# Rock vs Mine Prediction 🎯
This project applies machine learning classification techniques to predict whether an object detected by sonar signals is a rock or a mine. It uses the Sonar dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and demonstrates the full workflow of a predictive model — from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

🔹 Features
Dataset: Sonar signals (60 features per sample)

Task: Binary classification (Rock vs Mine)

Tools: Python, scikit-learn, pandas

Models: Logistic Regression

Evaluation: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualization

📂 Structure
Dataset/ → Contains the sonar dataset

Model/ → Jupyter Notebook with preprocessing, training, and evaluation

README.md → Project overview and usage instructions

🚀 Goal
To build a reliable ML model that can distinguish sonar signals reflected from rocks versus mines, showcasing practical applications of machine learning in signal processing and defense systems.
